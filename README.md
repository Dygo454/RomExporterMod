# RomExporterMod
WARNING:
  This mod may only work for my costum built redstone ROM chip as that is what it was designed for.


[link to redstone computer showcase possibly comming later as I am not sure yet on whether or not I will finish building the computer]

That said even then it only works in a specific orientation meaning that if my ROM chip is rotated the mod can't work propperly.
